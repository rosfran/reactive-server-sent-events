# Your task: the data harvester  🕵️‍♂️ #

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to create a program that harvest real time usage information
about the users of `video streaming events' server`. A list of requirements is available down below.  
In order to fulfill the assignment, you will have to consume three streaming endpoints by running the `video streaming events' server` on your machine as described [here.](StreamingPlatform.md)

## Mandatory requirements to implement 📜 ##

Your application should collect the data from all three streams for 20 seconds or until the third occurrence
of a user with first name `Sytac` on either of streams, whichever comes first.

The application should then output the aggregated view of the data collected, detailing:

+ user id
+ user's name and surname
+ user's age
+ all the events that the user has executed
+ platform where each event has occurred
+ the show titles
+ the first person in the cast for each show, if present
+ the show ids
+ event time in  Amsterdam (CET) timezone and `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS` format

and also:

+ the total number of shows released in 2020 or later (for any type of event)
+ for how long the 3 http streams were consumed by your harvester program, in milliseconds

The output should be either:

+ printed on standard output, or
+ written into a file, or
+ returned via an HTTP GET request.

You decide the output format and output method, observing that the output data is easily
interpreted by another program **and humans**.

Unfortunately, the server is bugged: from time to time the data returned is not well-formed. Feel free to skip these messages.

## Bonus points 🌟 ##

> The following requirements are optional. Develop these if you are looking to impress us!  

Along with the Mandatory requirements, collect:  

+ the total number of `successful streaming events` per user:
  + a successful streaming event is a defined as (sub)sequence of a `stream-started`, followed right after temporally by a `stream-ended` for the same show id and platform. For Example:
    + `[...,{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_01, sytflix, 02_01_2000},...]` => ✅ successful streaming event  
    + `[...,{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_01, sytazon, 02_01_2000},...]` => ❌ nothing (different platforms)  
    + `[...,{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_02, sytflix, 02_01_2000},...]` => ❌ nothing (different shows)
    + `[...,{stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {show_liked, s_01, sytflix, 02_01_2000}, {stream-ended, s_01, sytflix, 03_01_2000},...]` => ❌ nothing (show_liked in between)  
    + `[...,{stream-ended, s_01, sytflix, 01_01_2000}, {stream-started, s_01, sytflix, 02_01_2000},...]` => ❌ nothing (no closing stream-ended event)

+ the percentage of started stream events out of all events occurred on the `Sytflix` platform
